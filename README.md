# Programming-Assignment-2-
Bankerâ€™s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance

## Description
This project implements the Banker's Algorithm, The program reads the system state from an input file and determines whether the system is in a safe state. If the system is safe, it will print out a safe sequence of processes.

## Compilation and Execution
This program is written in C++ and can be compiled and run in a Linux environment.

## Compiling the Program
To compile the program, just need to put input.txt file and the bankers.cpp file in the same directory, the cpp file will automatically read it. 
Here is a example:
    1. Save input.txt and bankers.cpp to the desktop in a Linux environment.
    2. Open the terminal and type: "cd ~/Desktop"
    3."g++ -o bankers bankers.cpp"
    4."./bankers"
